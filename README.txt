Hello.

Exercises 1 and 3 were grand but Exercise 2 is difficult.

To see if my Exercise 2 algorithm is any way efective, I used ThreeJS to visualize the inputted hyperspace bombs and the calculated "safety spot".

The Exercise2/ThreeJS/firstTestCaseHyperspace.html ile is overwritten every time the tests are run.

Simple observation of firstTestCaseHyperspace.html indicates my alorithm is not good at finding "safest" spot but I believe the approach still has some merit.
